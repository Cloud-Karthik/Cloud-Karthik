### Welcome to Cloud Karthik GitHub Repository

üëã Hi there! I'm Karthik, a passionate AWS DevOps engineer, particularly excited by the challenge of optimizing CI/CD pipelines to deliver applications faster and more reliably.

As a DevOps and AWS engineer, I design, build, and operate efficient cloud computing solutions using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

With over 8 years, and 7 months of combined IT and non-IT experience, I bring 3.5 years of expertise in provisioning, operating, and managing AWS environments at INI Pharma. I'm well-versed in modern development and operations (DevOps) processes and methodologies, and I can implement and manage continuous delivery systems on AWS to streamline software releases.

I streamlined their deployment process by implementing an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipeline utilizing Terraform alongside Jenkins and configuration management solutions. This, combined with tools like Ansible, Tomcat, Docker, and Kubernetes with Python scripting, resulted in a 20% reduction in deployment time.

I'm always eager to learn emerging technologies and collaborate with creative minds to bring innovative projects to life.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### Project 1: AI Chatbot Integration
   Project Scope: This project aims to develop a Medical AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM) and based on the GPT-2 architecture. The target audience is patients suffering from both chronic and acute illnesses. The chatbot will provide users with information about their health conditions, including symptoms and causes.

#### Key Functionalities:

- **Disease Information Retrieval:** Users can interact with the chatbot to learn about various health conditions, including symptoms and potential causes.
- **Predictive Health Analysis (Future Development):** This functionality is under development and aims to leverage the user's medical history and lifestyle data to predict potential future health complications and organ-specific risks.

#### Technical Specifications:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Framework: OpenAI LLM (GPT-2 based)
- Target Platform: (Specify platform, e.g., web-based, mobile app)
- Data Sources: (Specify data sources for medical information, if applicable)
   
#### Role: Research & Developing LLM-based medical chatbot using OpenAI GPT-2 model, and integrating in 3-tier architecture using CI/CD DevOps tools in the AWS cloud.

### Project 2: 3-tire HA Web Application
   Developing a High-Availability 3-tier architecture website, updating every interval using DevOps tools, and deploying a WordPress website on AWS.

   Deploying Internal Medical Applications on AWS Cloud using EC2, Amazon S3, Cloud Front, and Route53 core components.

### Project 3: High-Availability on AWS
   Designed and Developed a simple medical website and deployed it on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket, this S3 service can be configured as a website hosting and securing with the IAM policies and deployed S3 server into the AWS‚Äôs Cloud Front content distribution network service.
